**** Org Mode

Use a function to render markdown in between JSX. Much Simpler
**** HTML

**** Markdown
** TODO Notes will have Chat / Discussion
** TODO Notes will have an abstract field
This will be shown during search
** TODO Will Folders be Subpages or Folders?
- [ ] How to handle an index page?
  - Having title as index could have dupes
  - Just extract the folder content as the index page
** TODO Homepage will be an index page in the database written in JSX
That way I can do as I like but just edit the thing to do it all at runtime.
** TODO transclusion
Then we can write jsx as a note and transclude it as a widget!
* First Steps
** Layout
** Users
** Docker Container
** Modify Components Layout
*** TODO Move Stories Next to Components
Better LLM and in Place Docs
*** TODO Remove index exports
Minimizes need for deps in consuming libraries
