* Feature Goals
** TODO Multiple Inputs
*** Overview
- [ ] Org Mode
- [ ] JSX
- HTML
  - Toggle WYSIWYG with CKEditor
- [ ] Markdown
*** Discussion
**** Org Mode
**** JSX
Use a function to render markdown in between JSX. Much Simpler
**** HTML

**** Markdown
** TODO Notes will have Chat / Discussion
** TODO Notes will have an abstract field
This will be shown during search
** TODO Will Folders be Subpages or Folders?
- [ ] How to handle an index page?
  - Having title as index could have dupes
  - Just extract the folder content as the index page
** TODO Homepage will be an index page in the database written in JSX
That way I can do as I like but just edit the thing to do it all at runtime.
** TODO transclusion
Then we can write jsx as a note and transclude it as a widget!
* First Steps
** Layout
*** TODO Hide the dock on Mobile
** Schema
*** Tables
**** Shares
Later, we'll need the server to filter what is permitted and implement things like share all children, share only item etc.
**** Tags
***** Tags
- id
- title
- parent_id
***** NoteTags
- tag_id
- note_id
**** Notes
