#+TITLE: Lilium
* Feature Goals
** TODO Multiple Inputs
*** Overview
- [ ] Org Mode
- [ ] JSX
- HTML
  - Toggle WYSIWYG with CKEditor
- [ ] Markdown
*** Discussion
**** Org Mode
**** JSX
Use a function to render markdown in between JSX. Much Simpler
**** HTML

**** Markdown
** TODO Notes will have Chat / Discussion
** TODO Notes will have an abstract field
This will be shown during search
** TODO Will Folders be Subpages or Folders?
- [ ] How to handle an index page?
  - Having title as index could have dupes
  - Just extract the folder content as the index page
** TODO Homepage will be an index page in the database written in JSX
That way I can do as I like but just edit the thing to do it all at runtime.
** TODO transclusion
Then we can write jsx as a note and transclude it as a widget!
* First Steps
** Layout
*** TODO Hide the dock on Mobile
** Schema
*** Tables
**** Notes
- id
- title
- abstract
- content
- syntax / syntax id (avoiding joins is simpler, just use ext as id)
- parent_id
- user_id
**** Tags
***** Tags
- id
- title
- parent_id
***** NoteTags
- tag_id
- note_id
*** Views
**** Notes With Number of Children
**** All Notes under a Tag
**** Search obviously
** Users
** Docker Container
** Modify Components Layout
*** TODO Move Stories Next to Components
Better LLM and in Place Docs
*** TODO Remove index exports
Minimizes need for deps in consuming libraries
* On the Fly
** TODO WAL on the DB
** TODO Dummy Data From Python
** TODO Create New Notes
** TODO Drop the note id search parameter and juse use the param =note/:id=
This will conflict with our need to preserve the `?sidebar=` searchParam (which is in turn useful for sending a link with a focused sidebar)
** TODO CRUD
*** TODO Folders
*** TODO Notes
** TODO Transitions
** TODO Sidebar needs to focus the note from the url
** TODO Sidebar transition is wrong.
** TODO Context Menu
** TODO Move the Sql into CRUD folders
** TODO Create associated.ts files with the server side function
** TODO Command Palette
** TODO Breadcrumbs in the Navbar
** TODO Context Menu
